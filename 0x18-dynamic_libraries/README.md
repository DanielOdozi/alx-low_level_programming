## C

**By:** Julien Barbier
**Weight:** 1

**Project will start:** Oct 16, 2023 6:00 AM
**Must end by:** Oct 17, 2023 6:00 AM
**Checker will be released at:** Oct 16, 2023 12:00 PM
**An auto review will be launched at the deadline**

### Resources

Read or watch:

- What is the difference between Dynamic and Static library (Static and Dynamic linking)
- Create dynamic libraries on Linux

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
- What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
- What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
- What are the differences between static and shared libraries
- Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

**Copyright - Plagiarism**

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet the above learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else's work. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements

**C**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won't be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file

**Bash**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- All your files must be executable

### Tasks

**0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life (mandatory)**

Create the dynamic library `libdynamic.so` containing all the functions listed below:

```c
int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
